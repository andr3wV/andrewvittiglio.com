summary: Why "perfect is the enemy of good" has become a dangerous excuse for accepting broken systems instead of actually good ones.

I've spent the last six months building dev tools for [C2PA](https://c2pa.org), a specification for embedding provenance metadata into digital media. [Que](https://addque.org) is a project I've been working on to make C2PA implementations easier, which means I've had a front-row seat to the standard's evolution. In that time, a concerning pattern has emerged: when you point out a flaw, a gap, or a design decision that undermines the system's security guarantees, someone occasionally chimes in with a familiar refrain: _"Well, perfect is the enemy of the good."_

It's not ubiquitous, but it's persistent enough to be troubling.

## What C2PA Is and Why This Phrase is Everywhere

For those who are unaware, C2PA is an attempt to combat digital misinformation by cryptographically signing media metadata. The promise is compelling: any media file could carry an unforgeable chain of custody from camera shutter to social media feed ("glass to glass" security as cryptographer [Dan Boneh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Boneh) coined). In theory, you'd know the origin of content and how it was modified along the way.

The [specification](https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/index.html) is complex. It uses X.509 certificates, deeply nested manifests embedded in file formats, and a trust model that relies on a federated registry of entities. For most software engineers who aren't security experts, this complexity is a significant barrier (which is exactly why [Que](https://addque.org) exists). On paper, it's sophisticated. In practice, it's a house of cards.

The problem is that **C2PA has a lot of flaws**. Not minor edge cases, but fundamental problems that people like [HackerFactor have been documenting extensively](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog). Every time someone points out that the foundation is cracked, the response isn't "let's fix the foundation." It's "perfect is the enemy of the good." I've heard it during working group meetings, from product managers at Adobe, and even in GitHub issues.

At first, I nodded along. It's a classic aphorism, a reminder not to let idealism block progress. But after hearing it used as a shield turning legitimate criticism into petulant perfectionism, I've come to a different conclusion: **Perfect isn't the enemy of good. "Good enough" is the enemy of "actually good."**

The core issue is that the expression implies a false binary. It suggests that _any_ solution is inherently "good," and that critics are merely chasing an impossible ideal.

But "good" isn't a boolean attribute. It exists on a spectrum.

When Voltaire [coined the phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good), he was warning against letting the unattainable prevent the achievable. He wasn't arguing that we should accept solutions that fail at their primary purpose. A better framing would be: **"The pursuit of perfect is the enemy of a sufficiently good-enough solution."**

The key word is _sufficiently_.

In engineering, there is a hard line where a solution stops being "good but imperfect" and starts being "useless." A bridge that can support 95% of expected traffic is imperfect but good. A bridge that collapses under its own weight is not "good enough", it is a liability.

Yet "perfect is the enemy of good" is often used to blur this line. It attempts to categorize sufficiency failures as imperfection. When a system fails to deliver on its core value proposition, it isn't "good." It’s broken. And pointing out that something is broken isn't perfectionism; it is the bare minimum requirement of engineering.

## A Culture of "Good Enough" is Failing Us

The phrase has been weaponized to lower the bar so far that "exists" becomes the new definition of "good." It has become a conversational cheat code across tech culture that transforms engineering rigor into obstructionism, framing the critic as an idealist and the defender as a pragmatist. On many issues, we have effectively shut down necessary debate about quality and safety.

When we defend broken systems with aphorisms instead of fixes, we're not being pragmatic. We're being irresponsible. **"Good enough" has become the enemy of "actually good," and the cost is measured in the degradation of trust and real-world harm.**

I don't need C2PA (or any software) to be perfect. I need it to be _good enough_ to trust. I need it to be better than nothing, and in many cases, it isn't. Instead of reaching for Voltaire, we should be reaching for our keyboards, opening an IDE, and actually try fixing the problems. Because in engineering "good enough" isn't good enough, and pretending otherwise helps no one.
