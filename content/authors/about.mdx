My goal is to develop scalable and robust software to connect people and help people. I'm most experienced in building financial infrastructure, but I also deeply interested in 
artificial intelligence, quantitative trading, and automation. 

I graduated university in May 2025 with degrees in Computer Science and Economics. While in college, I co-founded [CR3 Markets](https://cr3markets.com) a public marketplace for fractionalized commercial real estate. Since then, Iâ€™ve helped a number of pre-revenue startups design their system architecture, prototype MVPs, and streamline deployments. In my free time, I play chess, workout, travel, and watch Boston sports!
