My goal is to develop scalable and robust software to connect people, form unexpected relationships, and introduce people 
to "new" in whatever form that may take. I'm most interested in building robust financial infrastructure, but I also dabble in 
artificial intelligence, quantitative trading, and automation in the legal and finance space. 

Currently, I am the CTO & co-founder of [CR3 Markets](https://cr3markets.com) building a public marketplace for commercial real estate. In my free time, I work on small projects, workout, travel, and watch Boston sports!
